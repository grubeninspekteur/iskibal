= AsciiDoc+Iskara

AsciiDoc+Iskara is an extended format of Iskara that allows embedding Iskara source and native AsciiDoc tables in a single document.
This has the following advantages:

* Rules and tables can be documented with rich formatting, like highlighting
* Decision tables can use colspan to not repeat conditional columns
//TODO other advantages?

Rules written in AsciiDoc+Iskara are always first compiled to Iskara.
Thus, the chain becomes:

*Iskara+AsciiDoc prepropcessor* -> _<Iskara document>_ -> *Iskara parser* -> _<Iskibal rule model>_ -> *Rule compiler* -> <Rule format> -> *Rule engine*

// TODO write full documentation
